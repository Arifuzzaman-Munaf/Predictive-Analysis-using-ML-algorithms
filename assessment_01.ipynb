        "In the modern wine industry, the quality of the product is the paramount factor which determines the success in the market and brand reputation. The existing quality certification practices rely on the application of physicochemical tests and supplemented by sensory tests that are carried out by human experts (Nebot et al., 2015). This traditional approach creates a significant business problem as it fully relies on subjective human taste and the process is also expensive. Moreover, these tests occur at the end of the production cycle when a huge portion of time and money have already been invested. This late quality assessment makes the discovery of a poor-quality batch particularly costly  as the entire production process may need to be repeated. <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "This project directly addresses the inefficiency and financial risk of this reactive quality control model. The objective of the project is to design a predictive analytics model based on the machine learning (ML) techniques using the well-known <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality\">Wine Quality</a> dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to estimate the quality of wine(ranging from 0 to 10) based on its objective physicochemical characteristics. Such a model will help solve the business problem by transforming quality assessment from a subjective, lagging indicator into an objective, data-driven decision support system. Consequently, winemakers could easily keep track and control quality trends during the production time, referring to the model findings in order to make timely modifications, improving the end product and minimizing the risk of creating low-quality batches (Nebot et al., 2015).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.1 Success Criteria\n",
        "Technical effectiveness of the project is measured by three main criteria which correlate modeling results with a real business value.\n",
        "* **Benchmark Predictive Accuracy**: A predictive model will be developed using advanced algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting) that achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 0.50. This performance is required to represent at least a 15% accuracy improvement over a standard linear regression baseline\n",
        "* **Actionable Feature Extraction**: The project will have to determine and prioritize the key physicochemical determinants of wine quality, such as alcohol levels, acidity, and sulphates. This analytical insights gives winemakers the intelligence needed to maximise production by making targeted decisions.\n",
        "* **Robust Multi-Metric Validation**: Model superiority will be confirmed through robust validation using two key metrics. Performance will be measured using Mean Absolute Error(MAE) in order to make it easy to interpret business. Besides, the Coefficient of Determination (R-squared) will be utilized to confirm the ability of the model to explain variance in quality scores.\n"
