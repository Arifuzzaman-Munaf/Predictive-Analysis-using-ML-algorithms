        "The traditional process of winemaking relies heavily on subjective, time-consuming and expensive sensory analysis through human experts to certify quality. This assessment often occurs at the final stage of production highlighting significant financial risk if a batch is deemed unsatisfactory (Nebot et al., 2015). This project confronts this challenge by leveraging machine learning to create a proactive and data-driven quality control system.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of this project is to develop a robust binary classification model capable of predicting wine quality with high accuracy. The analysis will utilize the well-regarded Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which contains detailed physicochemical measurements. To frame this as a classification problem, the original quality score (ranging from 0 to 10) is transformed into a categorical variable such as wines with a score below 6 are labeled as 'low' quality (1), and those with a score of 6 or above are labeled as 'high' quality (0).\n",

The ultimate value of the resulting model will be measured by its predictive power and assessed through rigorous evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and AUC-ROC curve. A successful model would provide winemakers with an objective tool to forecast quality early, enabling timely interventions and minimizing the risk of costly production failures.\n",

        "## 1.1 Success Criteria\n",
        "The success criteria for this project is fundamentally tied to the statistical power and reliability of the classification model. To ensure the final model is robust enough for practical application, a competitive evaluation of multiple algorithms and parameter sets will be conducted. The \"champion\" model will be selected based on its superior performance against two specific critical metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Primary Metric (F1-Score):** An F1-Score of $ \\ge 0.70 $ for the 'low' quality (1) class is the most critical hurdle. This metric is chosen because it effectively manages the business trade-offs. A False Negative (failing to detect a low-quality batch) is the most costly error potentially leading to wasted resources and reputational damage. A False Positive (flagging a good batch for review) is less costly but still inefficient. The F1-Score ensures the model finds an optimal balance by maximizing the detection of bad batches while minimizing unnecessary interventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Overall Performance (AUC-ROC):** An AUC-ROC score of $ \\ge 0.80 $ is required to confirm the generalization capability of the model. This metric provides a holistic assessment of how well the model can distinguish between high and low-quality wines across all possible decision thresholds. A high AUC value reflects that the model has discovered important and underlying trends in the data rather than an ability to perform well at only a particular and arbitrary cutoff value.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The model with the highest F1-Score among the considered models that also exceeds the minimum level of AUC-ROC will be considered as the best solution. After selecting the champion model based on its performance, the next critical step is to analyze its interpretability by extracting feature importance. This activity considers the variables of physicochemistry one by one and then ranks the variables based on their contribution to the final quality prediction. Success in this case implies providing the best 3-5 variables that always generate a classification of a wine. For example, the model might reveal that low alcohol content combined with high volatile acidity are the most powerful predictors of a \"low quality\" rating. This elevates the model from a simple predictive tool to a diagnostic system. It gives winemakers a fine-grained and data-driven answer to consider a batch is at risk, so that they can target intervention actions on specific chemical characteristics and eventually improve the production process end to end."
